# Contributing to Kombustion

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute.

Make sure you have run `gofmt` before you submit the PR. This takes care of any
styling inconsistencies.

## I wrote a patch

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include
the relevant issue number if applicable.

## I want to add a new feature

Before you start on the feature, please create an issue and describe what it is
you would like to add.

Most new functionality should be able to be provided by plugins, so we would
rather discuss the new feature before you put time into writing it.
